Peter wishes to share his own notebook with Tom for a period of time to enable him to
learn and practice using the Wordpad program.
Peter’s personal documents are stored in different folders in the notebook. He is
concerned that these documents may be subjected to unauthorized access. Furthermore,
Peter does not want Tom misuse the notebook other than for the intended purpose of
learning Wordpad.
The scope of misuse of his notebook includes installing/uninstalling new/existing software,
deleting files and saving files all over the folders in the system, and using MS Edge to
connect to the Internet. Peter would like to limit Tom’s storage quota to 50MB, with a
warning at 40MB. Tom should not have access to internet or any other devices through
Peter’s connections on the notebook.
